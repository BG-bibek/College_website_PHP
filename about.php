            <br>
            <p>Established in the year 2010, situated at the heart of Kathmandu, Sunway has been providing business as MBA and IT Education as BCS at the Bachelors and Masters level in Kathmandu.
                Having experience and exposure with various Universities abroad, Sunway has gathered significant experience in imparting Business ( MBA ) and IT Education ( BCS ) for Nepalese students.
                As it is universally accepted fact that having a degree is not sufficient to secure future career, we at Sunway, prepare students to become as a serious contender for various positions in multinational companies as well as local companies.
                At the same time, we encourage students to see themselves as a job provider rather than job seeker. In order to achieve this, Entrepreneurship skills run across all academic and non academic activities.
                We put significant emphasis in student centred learning, critical thinking and soft skills. Apart from providing students with adequate infrastructure and facilities, real life problem solving and case studies are incorporated as a regular academic activities.

                We are committed to mint our students to the highest academic and professional standard who will become a believer in change, responsible and innovative once they complete one of our courses. Students wishing to graduate with highly employable skills and entrepreneurship spirit are highly encouraged to consider Sunway as their further education institution.</p>
